# React Portfolio

## Description

Here is a MVP for my React Portfolio. I have used React to create this single page application. 

In the header of the page is my name and navigation. I use React router to navigate through the page. user lands to Home page:

![home](./public/imgREADME/home.jpg)

When Contact link is clicked, my contact information is displayed, with the links to GitHub and LinkedIn:

![contact](./public/imgREADME/contact.jpg)

When Projects link is clicked, it takes user to my project page.

Each project has an image, name and two buttons - one takes user to my GitHub repository for this project and another - to deployed site. 

![projects](./public/imgREADME/projects.jpg)
