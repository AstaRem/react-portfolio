# React Portfolio

## Description 
### version 1.0

Here is a MVP for my React Portfolio(scroll down to see improved version 2.0 screenshots). I have used React to create this single page application. 

In the header of the page is my name and Navigation. I use React Router to navigate through the page. User lands to Home page:

When Contact link is clicked, my contact information is displayed, with the links to GitHub and LinkedIn:

![contact](./public/imgREADME/contact.jpg)

When Projects link is clicked, it takes user to my project page.

Each project has an image, name and two buttons - one takes user to my GitHub repository for this project and another - to deployed site.

This is working MVP site for my portfolio and it is work in progress. I am in the process of updating it with the better visual design solutions.
